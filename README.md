# Web_Automation

This is web automation script which automates the laborious task of updating many lines routing information on a mobile company website. This platform uses splinter( a selenium wrapper), openpyxl(to modify and read excel file). This is a private website so I can not give the access of the website. Hoever, I am including a demonastration video.
